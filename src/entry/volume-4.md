# Volume 4: Suspiciously Divisible by 2

Last week we were light on hacks in order to spend some time talking
to [Phil Hagelberg](http://technomancy.us). If you missed it, I urge
you to [check it out](http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=3489d30623dcf96e5ac9f4d53&id=bf8e561139)!

This week there's no 7 page interview, so it's back to tradition. Let's
get to the hacks!

# Hacks (in no particular order)

## Overtype --- Ben Wheeler

Overtype simulates a typewriter, and does a very good job. My favorite
hack in a while!  Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to have a free
license associated with it, but the code is well documented and fun to
explore!

## git-link --- Skye Shaw

Let's imagine you edit code in emacs, and want to send a link to a
friend of exactly the spot where they made a mistake. The code is on
Gitlab, or Github. Do you open up a browser? No! You `M-x git-link` it
and paste a link instead.

## rlite --- Sebastian Waisbrot

rlite is to redis as sqlite is to *insert RDBMS here*

* [rlite on Github](https://github.com/seppo0010/rlite)

## pigz --- Mark Adler

"pig-zee" is a parallel gzip implementation that makes use of, you
guessed it, multi-processor, multi-core machines. I haven't done any
benchmarking, but I imagine it to be faster, at best, than typical
gzip. *[See what I did there? -- ed]*

* [homepage](http://www.zlib.net/pigz/)

## Neon --- Mike Amaral

A new framework for creating dynamic and flexible UIs for iDevices in
Swift. I'm not an iDeveloper, but I assume this can also be used for
generic, run of the mill, soon to be deprecated, desktop applications
for the Mac as well.

## speed-test --- Sindre Sorhus

Don't have flash? But want to brag about your connection to your
coworkers? No problem! Just do it from your terminal.

* [speed-test on Github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/speed-test)

## sift --- Sven Taute

A faster alternative to grep. Doesn't say which grep implementation
it's faster than. Seems fast anyway. Very flexible.

* [homepage](https://sift-tool.org/)
* [sift on Github](https://github.com/svent/sift)

## litestore --- Fabio Cevasco

A NoSQL document store built on top of sqlite, and written in [Nim](http://nim-lang.org/)!

# Fun things to read or see

* [Strangeloop 2015 videos are up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Aa4PivG0g&list=PLcGKfGEEONaCIl5eU53uPBnRJ9rbIH32R).

* [Statistics for Hackers](https://speakerdeck.com/jakevdp/statistics-for-hackers):
  I still couldn't follow it all. I wonder if there's a video of this
  talk? That might be helpful.

* [The Guide to Implementing 2d Platformers](http://higherorderfun.com/blog/2012/05/20/the-guide-to-implementing-2d-platformers). This came up again recently in the social sites, and I read it again. Yup, still very informative and inspiring.


# Tying a bow.

I love to be told of interesting new hacks, projects, pieces of art, and
of course random algorithms. If you have something that you think I haven't
seen challenge me by sending it my way! Just reply to this email. Easy peasy.

Until next time!

Happy hacking,

Andrew

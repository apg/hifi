# Volume 11: Go for it, Connect 4!

*Welcome, new subscribers (I have no idea where you came from, but I'm happy you're here)! And, hello to everyone tuning in for another edition!*

Long before [hifi](http://hifibyapg.com), I did a similar thing in blog form called [fold](http://fold.sigusr2.net), more regularly, same type of commentary, possibly more oriented at blog posts than projects. This week, I was flipping through the pages of it, and was saddened to see that a large amount of the posts link to the ether. I'm sure the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) has a portion of them, but it got me thinking.

A neat browser plugin would modify the current page with [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) buttons next to hyperlinked text. An even neater browser plugin would attempt to figure out the date in which the link was linked to, using clues like post time, if it appears to be a blog, or news article. Both of these tools probably already exist, but I'll almost certainly never install them, so I'll just complain again in 2 years when I revisit fold. Of course, I wouldn't have had this problem at all if I had just been "blogging with [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in)," and it's archive feature. So say we all.

# Things to read

* [Handmade Manifesto](http://static.chronal.net/hmh/manifesto.html)
* [500 Lines or Less](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) is out. I was a reviewer, but neither chapter I reviewed made it into the final book. I guess I was too harsh? Or, more likely, the authors got busy and had no time to respond to feedback / keep up with the editing process.
* [Distributed Systems Theory for the Distributed Systems Engineer](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/distributed-systems-theory-for-the-distributed-systems-engineer/) is an a few years old now, but never not relevant.
* [Reverse Engineering for Beginners](http://beginners.re/#lite) is a free book, which I'll, unfortunately, almost certainly never have time for. 

# Boilerplate wrapup

I'm always on the lookout for interesting hacks, projects, pieces of
art, neat papers, etc. If you have something I should see, don't
hesitate to reply to this email!

Oh! And, are you or someone you know working on a big project with an
interesting story (or even a boring story, but with interesting
problems)? Let me know! I'd love to ch chat with you/them.

Until next time!

Happy hacking,

Andrew

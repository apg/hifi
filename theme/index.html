          <p><strong>hifi</strong> is a weekly-ish email newsletter to inspire
            hackers. <em>It</em> was inspired by the good 'ole days when
            I, <a href="http://apgwoz.com">apg</a>,
            ran <a href="http://hackandtell.org">Hack &amp;&amp; Tell</a> in
            NYC. Just what the hell is Hack &amp;&amp; Tell? Glad you asked. It's
            a "show and tell" for hacker types. The kinds of people who sit home
            and write code for fun, because they are passionate about their
            <code>.bashrc</code> file. Or, their editor. Or, silly things like displaying
            animated gifs in their terminals. Or, building audio workstations
            because it's a fun challenge. </p>

          <p>Hack &amp;&amp; Tell <em>celebrates</em> those people and their projects by giving
            them a venue to talk about them and solicit feedback, live and in
            person.</p>

          <p>hifi isn't that. Well, it's partly that. We <em>celebrate</em>
            people's projects but they don't usually even know that we are. But, maybe
            you, the reader, are now inspired to help the original author make it
            better. Or give them feedback. Or reach out to them and say, "Woah! I
            love this thing that you wrote for fun and it makes my life
            wonderful."</p>

          <p>hifi by apg attempts to find these types of projects, packages them
            up with some dry humor and sends them your way. We also throw in
            occasional interviews with real people, links to papers and
            interesting blog posts, and from time to time challenge you to a
            puzzle.</p>

          <p>Just <em>who is apg</em>, and why should you trust him to inspire
            you weekly? He's just a lonely distributed systems engineer who lives
            in paradise, deals with imposter syndrome, and happens to follow lots
            of interesting links to random inspiring projects. Just look at the
            crap he recently wrote about:</p>

          <p>Still not convinced?  Well then: how about some of these grand
            testimonials? From <em>real</em> people?</p>

          <p>"I wouldn't say hifi is particularly useful to me, though I have
            gotten exposure to several new projects. That said, it <em>is</em> delightful
            to me. It inspires me towards being a better hacker and I view it as a celebration of hacker culture." &mdash; <a href="http://justin.abrah.ms">Justin Abrahms</a></p>

          <p>"I get a number of weekly tech projects newsletter type
            things, and MOSTLY they all have ~70-80% overlap in terms of the stuff they
            link to.  I have about 0-10% overlap from the stuff here, which is
            fantastic!" &mdash; <a href="http://mroth.info">Matthew Rothenberg</a></p>

          <p>"It's been a wonderful addition to my week." &mdash; <a href="http://amerine.net">Mark Turner</a></p>

          <p>That was some strong convincing, right? Click <a href="#signup_form">here</a>, and we'll take you back
            to that form you skipped before, K?</p>

          <p><em><strong>Still</strong></em> skeptical? How about some testimonials from <em>fake</em> people then?</p>

          <p>"hifi by apg changed my life. I was at my desk living off of nibbles and bytes
            from Hacker News. Then my friend Steve forwarded me hifi. Never again will
            I scour the internet for 'Show HN' posts." &mdash; Jillian</p>

          <p>"I've spent my whole career searching for that one shell hack that will make
            me productive. Now hifi does it for me instead." &mdash; Jeff</p>

          <p>OK, you've convinced me now! Take me to the <a href="#signup_form">signup form</a> again.</p>
